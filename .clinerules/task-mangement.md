# Task Execution Guidelines

1. **Update `TASKS.md` After Completion:**  
   After completing any task, always update the `TASKS.md` file to reflect the current progress.

2. **One Task per Session:**  
   Focus on only one task during a single session to maintain clarity and avoid context-switching.

3. **Mandatory Testing Before Completion:**  
   Before marking a task as complete, run all relevant tests to ensure that the implemented functionality works correctly.
